Is the system's time-domain output sequence when the input is a single unity-valued sample ([[Unit impulse]]) preceded and followed by zero-valued samples.
![[Unit impulse]]
If we know about the *unit impulse response* of an LTI system, we can calculate everything about the system. This is because the ouput is equal to the [[Convolution]] of the input sequence and the system's impulse response.

Given an LTI system's time-domain impulse response, we can find the system's *frequency response* by taking the *discrete Fourier transform* of that impulse response.
