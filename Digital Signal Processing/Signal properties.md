## Amplitude
Is the measure of how large, and in what direction a variable differs from zero.
## Magnitude
Is the absolute value of amplitude.
## Power
The power of a signal is proportional to its amplitude (or magnitude) squared.

Depends on the proportionality constant, we can calculate the power of a signal from its amplitude.

When examining signals in the frequency domain, we'll often interested in the power level of those signals.
