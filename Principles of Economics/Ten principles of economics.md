# How people make decisions
## Principle 1: People face trade-offs
Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another. There are many trade-offs in life. Knowing it won't tell us what decisions people will or should make. But understanding what are the options to them will enable them to make good decisions.
## Principle 2: The cost of something is what you give up to get it
The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item. It literally means whatever must be given up to obtain some item.
## Principle 3: Rational people think at the margin
We won't go into who are rational people but go straight to *margin* part. The choices in life aren't black and white but involves shades of gray.
For example, when the exam comes around, you won't think about blowing it off or study 24 hours per day. Instead you will ponder wherever or not to spend an extra hour to study or play games.
Economists use the term **marginal change** to describe a small incremental adjustment to a plan of action.
So each marginal change has associated **marginal benefits** and **marginal costs**.
## Principle 4: People respond to incentives
An **incentive** is something that induces a person to act, such as the prospect of a punishment or reward.
Incentives are *key* to analyze how the markets work.
