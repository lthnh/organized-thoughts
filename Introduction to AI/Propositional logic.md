- $\alpha \models \beta$ means $\beta$ is a necessary consequence of $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $\alpha$ entails $\beta$
	- This is *logical inference*
- $KB \vdash _i \alpha$ means $\alpha$ is derived from $KB$ by $i$
	- Also means $i$ derives $\alpha$ from $KB$
	- An inference algorithm that derives only entailed sentences is called *sound* or *truth-preserving*
		- An unsound inference produces essentially makes things up as it goes along
	- An inference algorithm that can derive any sentences that is entailed $\rightarrow$ it's complete
## Syntax (of propositional logic)
- The atomic sentences consist of a single *propositional variable*
	- Each symbol represents a proposition $\rightarrow$ can be either true or fale
- Complex sentences are constructed from simpler sentences using parentheses and logical connectives
	- Five logical connectives
		- $\lnot$ (not)
			- $\lnot W_{1, 3}$ is the *negation* of $W_{1, 3}$
			- A literal is either
				- an atomic sentence
				- a negated atomic sentence
		- $\land$ (and)
			- A sentence with $\land$ as main connective is conjunction
				- Ex: $P \land Q$
			- Its parts are the *conjuncts*
		- $\lor$ (or)
			- A sentence with $\lor$ as main connective is disjuntion
				- Ex: $P \lor Q$
			- Its parts are the *disjuncts*
		- $\implies$ (implies)
			- A sentence such as $P \implies Q$ is called an *implication*
			- P is *premise* or *antecedent*
			- Q is *conclusion* or *consequent*
		- $\iff$ (if and only if)
			- The sentence with this symbol as main connective is a *biconditional*
- Operator precedence: $\lnot, \land, \lor, \implies, \impliedby$
- The above is BNF (Backus-Naur Form) notion
## Semantics
- Defines the rules for determining the truth of a sentence with respect to a particular model
- In propositional logic, a model sets the *truth value* - true or false - for every proposition symbol
